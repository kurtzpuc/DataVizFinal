# DataViz

This repository is the work from my Data Visualization Course at the University of Chicago in the 2022-23 academic school year. It includes all assignments and projects from the class.

Within this repo, you'll find a variety of projects, including my final project, a visualization on how climate change and sea temperatures have impacted commercial fishing and the alaskan economy over time. Please email kurtz.h.piper@gmail.com for access to the private repository.
